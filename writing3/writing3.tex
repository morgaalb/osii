% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[journal]{../sty/IEEEtran}





% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and 
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with 
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/endfloat
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\begin{adjustwidth}{2in}{2in}
In his report, \textit{Interrupts}, OSU computer science major
Albert Morgan compares how the Linux, BSD, and Windows operating
systems handle interrupts, including the system timer, which
relies on interrupts to work.
Morgan's report uses research from three different technical
textbooks to create summaries of
each operating system and compare their functionality side-by-side.
Morgan uses these comparisons to make the point that Linux has the
most features, BSD is relatively straightforward, and Windows
is somewhere between Linux and BSD in complexity,
but works entirely different.
Morgan's report is written in an
academic manner for an audience already familiar with the internal
components of operating systems.

\section{Introduction}
This report will compare the way that Linux, BSD, and Windows handle
\textit{interrupts}.
Interrupts are special signals that are sent to the processor either from
devices or from the processor itself.
Interrupts inform the processor that some action needs to be taken.
Interrupts are important for modern computing for two
reasons.
First, without interrupts, the processor would have to check for these signals
using a technique called \textit{polling}. With polling, the processor will
check if a new event has occurred periodically at some interval,
often hundreds of times per second. 
This can cause a significant amount of overhead,
because the processor needs to check for the signal whether or not it
is there or not.
Second, interrupts allow the existence of the \textit{system timer}.
The system timer wakes up the operating system kernel every so often,
usually 100 or 1000 times per second,
at which point the kernel can perform the tasks that it needs to do,
such as scheduling processes for multitasking.
This allows for \textit{kernel preemption}, or forced context switches.
Without interrupts and kernel preemption, the kenel would have to wait
for a user process to voluntarily give up control before it takes back
over.
%
\subsection{Linux}
%
Interrupts need to run fast. Because an interupt could occur at any time,
it is important to process it as quickly as possible so that the
computer can get back to doing what it was doing before. An interrupt that
runs too long could disrupt other timing critical applications running
on the system.
However, sometimes there is a significant amount of processing that needs
to be performing by the interrupt.
For example, if the processor receives an interrupt informing it that
a network packet has just arrived,
it may be important to clear the incoming buffer and send an
acknowledgement as soon as possible,
but processing the actual bytes in the packet might not be as time critical.
In order to help with this, 
interrupt handlers in Linux are divided into two parts:
the \textit{top half} and the \textit{bottom half}.

The top half of the interrupt handler is the ``classic'' part of the
handler: it is the code that gets called when an interrupt happens,
interrupting the process that is currently running.
This is the part of the interrupt that needs to run quickly.
Parts of the interrupt that do not need to run quickly are deferred to
the bottom half, which runs later (i.e. not now).
The bottom half is where any deferred work that does not
absolutely have to get done right away is performed.
As of kernel version 2.3, Linux has three types of bottom halves:
\textit{softirqs}, \textit{tasklets}, and \textit{work queues}.

Softirqs are statically allocated at compile time. They do not
provide any serialization, which means two copies of the same
softirq can be running on two different processors concurrently.
Although interrupts are not run in any particular order,
softirqs are.
Listing~\ref{softirqc} shows how softirqs are executed in
priority order.
Tasklets are built on top of softirqs. They can be allocated
dynamically at runtime and are serialized: two copies of the same
tasklet cannot be running at the same time on \textit{any} processor.
Both softirqs and tasklets run in an interrupt context,
which means that neither are allowed to sleep.
Work queues, the final type of bottom half,
run in a process context, which means that they are allowed to sleep.

\lstinputlisting[language=c, caption={A simplified variant of the function that calls softirqs in priority order \cite{linux-kernel-dev}}, label={softirqc}]{softirq.c}

By default, 
the Linux system timer fires an interrupt every 10ms (100 times a second).
However, it is possible to change this value at compile time.
The Linux kernel also supports \textit{tickless operation}, which, instead
of the system timer interrupt firing after a predetermined period of time,
the kernel will figure out how long it needs to wait and schedule
the next system timer to fire then.

\textit{Exceptions} are caused when a process tries to do something illegal,
such as divide by zero. They are very similiar to interrupts,
and are handled in a nearly identical manner \cite{linux-kernel-dev}.


\subsection{BSD}

The BSD interrupt systems works similarly to Linux, although the names
are slightly different and there is not the same variety of bottom halves
available.

BSD interrupts are divided into two pieces, much like the Linux kernel.
The top half, which BSD calls a \textit{hardware interrupt} runs when
the interrupt is generated.
Work that can be deferred until later is run as a \textit{software interrupt},
which is BSD's version of the Linux's kernels's bottom half, and run
in a process context, similiar to work queues.

Unlike Linux, BSD uses a dynamic system timer. Before the kernel switches
context to another process, it estimates how long it can wait before
it needs to wake up again, and sets time of the next timer tick
appropriately. BSD has a system timer rate of 1000 ticks per second
(10 times the default value for Linux), but due to this dynamic
scheduling, the BSD kernel rarely wakes up at every possible timer
tick.
\cite{des-imp-bsd-os}.

\subsection{Windows}

In Windows, interrupts and exceptions are grouped into a single category
called \textit{traps}. Similiarly to Linux, interrupts are traps that
run asynchronously (i.e. they can occur at any time), whereas exceptions
occur synchronously (they are only caused by actions of the processor).

In Linux, interrupts are not serviced in any particular order
(although some bottom halves are).
However, in Windows, interrupts have an inherent priority.
Each interrupt source has a priority, and interrupts are
serviced according to the priority of that source.
These priorities are called \textit{Interrupt Request Levels},
or IRQLs. When an interrupt is run, Windows will raise
the IRQL of the processor to prevent lower priority
interrupts from preemting a higher priority interrupt. On Linux,
it is the interrupt handler's duty to mask out the interrupts that
it doesn't want to be preempted by. Figure~\ref{fig:intpriority}
shows the 32 interrupt priorities that Windows uses.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=10cm]{intpriority.eps}
\caption{Interrupt priorities on the Windows operating system
\cite{win-int-one}.
}
\label{fig:intpriority}
\end{figure}

Similiar to the bottom halves in Linux,
Windows provides a framework for deferring non-critical code until later.
The \textit{Dispatch or Deferred Procedure Call} (DPCs) are software
interrupts (i.e. interrupts that are synchronously caused by the processor)
that are used to defer work until later.
DPCs are most like Linux's tasklets,
because they cannot call functions which might block.
APCs, or \textit{Asynchronous Procedure Calls} allow Windows to run
code in the context of a specific user thread.
The fact that APCs run in a user context makes them similiar to
the Linux kernel's work queue, but there is one key difference:
whereas work queues run a bottom half in a user context,
an APC has the option to run in the context of a specific process.
This feature allows interrupt handlers to more easily interact
with user processes.

The system timer on Windows uses one processor to keep track of
the time: processor 0. Processor 0 receives a system clock
interrupt at regular interrupts, much like Linux. Unlike Linux,
this value is configurable at runtime, and if an application needs
a higher resolution timer, it can request that these interrupts happen
more often.
The other processors on the system use a form of tickless operation,
and when they sleep, will dynamically schedule the next
timer interrupt. This allows sleeping processors to stay in a sleeping
state longer, and conserve power. Windows calls this system
\textit{intelligent timer tick distribuion} \cite{win-int-one}.

\section{Conclusion}
The philosophies behind Linux and BSD interrupt handling are similiar,
although the naming conventions differ. Also, BSD does not have the
same variety of bottom halves that Linux does.

Windows uses the same principles of top and bottom halves to
defer work, but the specific bottom halves
(which Windows, like BSD, refers to as software interrupts)
operate differently. The key fucntional difference is that Asynchronous
Procedure Calls in Windows allow an interrupt handler to actually
run in the context of a specific running process, enabling
a more direct link between processes and interrupts.

% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat[]), but instead will
% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.
% Be aware that for subfig.sty to generate the (a), (b), etc., subfigure
% labels, the optional argument to \subfloat must be present. If a
% subcaption is not desired, just leave its contents blank,
% e.g., \subfloat[].


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the
% \caption command should come BEFORE the table and, given that table
% captions serve much like titles, are usually capitalized except for words
% such as a, an, and, as, at, but, by, for, in, nor, of, on, or, the, to
% and up, which are usually not capitalized unless they are the first or
% last word of the caption. Table text will default to \footnotesize as
% the IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.

%\begin{table}[!t]

% Note that the IEEE does not put floats in the very first column
% - or typically anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also,
% in-text middle ("here") positioning is typically not used, but it
% is allowed and encouraged for Computer Society conferences (but
% not Computer Society journals). Most IEEE journals/conferences use
% top floats exclusively. 
% Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places
% footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the
% \fnbelowfloat command of the stfloats package.
